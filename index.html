    <h1>Project Portofio</h1>
    <p class="description">These are some different projects I have created over my time in high school.</p>

     <p class="description">This is a simple game I designed in CodeHS. There is a basket moving randomly and a basketball that you control with the arrows on your keyboard. When you get 5 points, you can also get a power up.</p>
